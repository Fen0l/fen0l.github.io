Hi everyone, a little article to announce and present this blog, mine. I will use it mostly as a notepad. Put a lot of ideas, share content or stories. I going to try to write more as possible. Trust me, I am a busy men :).

About me, my name is [Anthony Pradal][anthonyp], a French IT student passionated about new technologies, bigdata, cloud, innovation and Apple. _(Haters, go back!)_.

 
### Technically speaking

This blog is running under [jekyll][jekyll]. And because I suck with design, I use a template created by [Ben Centra][bencentra] available [here][bencentra_repo]. It is hosted by [Github Page][github_page] _(I will do an article on it later)_. Trust me, GithubPage is life.

But even more, I use:
* Markdown 
* My mind

You can contact me at hello@anthonypradal.com I will reply with pleasure.
